# law-firm-management-system
This is a real-world Law Firm Management application from scratch using Django and PostgreSQL database . 
The Features are as follows 
1. Views for Lawyers Management:

The project includes creating views specifically for managing lawyer details. For example, a LawyerListView is implemented to list all lawyers, while a LawyerCreateView allows for the creation of new lawyer entries.
2. Views for Case Management:

Similarly, the project incorporates views for managing cases, including CaseListView for listing cases and CaseCreateView for adding new case records.
3. Model Integration:

Each view is connected to Django models, such as LawyerModel and CaseModel, ensuring a structured approach to data handling.
4. Templates:

The use of templates, like lawyer_list.html, facilitates the rendering of dynamic content for both lawyers and cases, providing users with a structured visual representation.
5. User Interaction:

The views and templates work together to create a user-friendly interface allowing users to interact with the system, making it easier to manage lawyers and cases efficiently.
